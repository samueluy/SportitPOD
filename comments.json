This shorter course in Fort Worth has always been a safe home to the diminutive players on tour setting up well for both players here. While Chris Kirk isn\u2019t out of form he did nothing well striking the ball or putting on Thursday in his round of 72. Hoge was 6 strokes better and the stats show why. Hoge was the best player on the course tee to green on Thursday via data golf gaining an astonishing 4.39 strokes on his approach. While many pegged Kirk as a course fit here I believe the same for Hoge and with Hoge in essence lapping Kirk in every measurable category on Thursday I think it\u2019s an uphill battle for Kirk to catch him tomorrow.

On the other hand Fils has only played through three sets managing to get two walkover wins back to back. While he's gotten to the semifinals once again Fils has yet to win one on the tour. He's been lucky, but the clay is his game and these last two walkovers has given him lots of rest. Now up against Nakashima who is no slouch, this will be a test just like his previous meetings with Bonzi and Sinner in those two semifinal matches. This match is evenly poised in my opinion, and can go either way. Both men are equally capable of winning this match, which is why I'm taking the over.",

    "body": "**PoTD Record: 13-3, +8.61u**\n\nLast Pick: FK Buducnost Podgorica ML vs Mornar @ -110 \u2705\n\n**Today\u2019s Pick: Phoenix Rising FC ML vs Las Vegas Lights FC @ -190**\n\n(25 hours from this post)\n\nHey All - Back at it today with the daily football/soccer play. The FK Buducnost play @ -110 was a hit and we seemingly jumped on an error by the sportsbooks if you managed to get in early enough as it peaked around -270. Based on the outpouring of private messages it seems like a lot of people took that winner so thrilled to hear that. \n\nWith that being said, we\u2019re going to tackle another lesser known league - USL Championship (USA). This is the second division of football here in the US and has a ton of smaller market teams that play in some fairly fun games. It\u2019s worth noting I\u2019m betting this on FanDuel here in the US. Knowing that there are a lot of international redditors here as well as redditors from all over the US, this may actually be obscure enough that it is not able to be bet where you are. Apologies if that\u2019s the case - we\u2019re going back to European Top 5 Leagues tomorrow!\n\nWith respect to the game, there\u2019s really two angles here. First and, perhaps less importantly, the Las Vegas Lights are last in the Western Division of the USL with a record of 0-6-4 through 10 games. In 8 of their 10 games this season, they\u2019ve only scored 1 goal or less but have managed to snag a ton of draws which shows some of their defensive formidability. Phoenix Rising is in the upper half of the table in the Western Conference (4-4-2, 16pts through 10 games) and following an uncharacteristic season last year they typically are a dominant team in the USL (Fun fact: this team became popular when Didier Drogba became a big investor and played for them for two seasons a few years ago).\n\nThe second angle to this bet is that it\u2019s $1 Beer Night. Stick with me here as this isn\u2019t a joke. Phoenix Rising FC is 16-0-0 in their $1 Beer Night promotion. This promotion became a huge deal several years ago where they were essentially unbeatable on this night haha. During the last several seasons (USL did not play in 2020), $1 Beer Night was not a promotion that was done and it was brought back this year for the home opener - another game they won. \n\nSo with all the being said, it should be a raucous night in Phoenix on Friday night. The home support should be plentiful (and electric I would have to assume). Couple this with the fact that the opposition has not won a game all year and we have ourselves a Play of The Day.\n\nAs I said, apologies if this game is not available to everyone and apologies for picking a game 25 hours away! For those that do tail, bet responsibly and lock in quickly. With it already being at -190 this line is bound to rise to a point where it\u2019s unplayable. See you all tomorrow. \n\n**1 Unit Play**\n\nBest of Luck!",

Can't really predict a 5 goal game unfortunately, especially when the stats were so in favour of a low scoring game. Guess Chelsea really are trash.\n\n**Summary:** Bit of a boring pick today but after getting burned yesterday, simple may be safer. Metz is looking for promotion into Ligue 1 and Sochaux has given up their race for promotion. In the Head-to-Head (6 matches), Metz has won 4 out of 6 matches, with the other two ending in draws.\n\nSochaux has never beat Metz. Sochaux is also on a 6 game losing streak, a streak I expect to continue tomorrow.\n\nMetz are unbeaten in 23 Ligue 2 games heading into this clash and have won 14 of those, including four wins in their last six away games.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\n***TLDR Metz should win and keep their hopes for promotion alive***\n\n**FC Sochaux vs. Metz | Metz to Win| 1.61 odds**",

They had 8 hits (avg 8.04) and 4 hits/run (avg 1.86). Hypothetically, we should see the Pittsburg be more efficient hitting wise this game.

He is 5-3 with a 2.62 ERA and a 1.01 WHIP. Mariners have won 3 straight against the A\u2019s, but previously had lost 4/5 games. Seattle isn\u2019t a great hitting team, averaging 7.71 hits.
